# Search-Alogorithm AI**

**This repo has python implementations for all AI search algorithms.**

Breadth-First Search (BFS):

BFS systematically explores all nodes at the current depth level before moving to the next level. It guarantees finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs or trees with uniform edge costs.
Depth-First Search (DFS):

DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It is often used in applications where finding any solution is sufficient, or in cases where memory usage is a concern.
Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS):

IDDFS combines the benefits of BFS and DFS by repeatedly performing DFS with increasing depth limits until the solution is found. It ensures completeness while avoiding excessive memory usage.
Uniform Cost Search (UCS):

UCS explores the least-cost path first, expanding nodes based on their path cost. It is suitable for graphs with non-uniform edge costs and guarantees finding the optimal solution.
s too large to be explored exhaustively. These algorithms iteratively improve candidate solutions based on local changes.
